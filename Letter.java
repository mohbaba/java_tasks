System.out.println("\t\t\t\tSubject: Repair of the road in Cheran Nagar\nSir,\nI would like to bring to your notice that the people in and around Cheran Nagar have been facing\n difficulties in travelling back and forth because of the bad condition of the roads there.We have\n appealed to the Municipality, but there has not been any response on the issue so far.As our \nappeals to their office have had no effect, we believe that perhaps a mention in the media would be \nof great help. Since the beginning of the last month, the roads in Cheran Nagar have been almost\n impassable. The surface is badly broken up by the heavy rains, and on a dark night, it is posit\nively dangerous for vehicles to pass that way. Moreover, there are heaps of road metal on both sid\nes of the road, which leave very little room in the middle. The residents of the area have been\n inconvenienced in this way for weeks.The situation is becoming worse. There have been multiple\n accidents happening due to this condition. I request you to highlight the seriousness of the\n matter in your newspaper so that the road may be properly repaired without further delay.");

System.out.println("We kindly request your assistance in bringing awareness to this issue through your esteemed news\npaper. We believe that a mention in the media will not only shed light on the challenges faced \nby the community but also prompt the relevant authorities to take immediate action in repairing\n the roads.The safety and well-being of the residents are at stake, and we trust that your news\npaper's influence can contribute to resolving this matter promptly. Your support in highlighting\n the seriousness of the situation will be highly appreciated by the community.Thank you for your\n attention to this matter, and we look forward to seeing positive changes in the near future.");
